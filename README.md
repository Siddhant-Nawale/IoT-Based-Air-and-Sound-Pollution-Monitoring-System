# IoT-Based-Air-and-Sound-Pollution-Monitoring-System

## Description

This project introduces an innovative IoT system designed for continuous monitoring of air and noise pollution levels. Utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), the system employs advanced sensors and connectivity to track and visualize pollution data over time. Key components include the ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module for computation and monitoring, the LM393 sound sensor for noise level detection, and the MQ135 air quality sensor for monitoring air pollution. The Blynk application is employed to display the collected data in a graphical format for easy interpretation.
